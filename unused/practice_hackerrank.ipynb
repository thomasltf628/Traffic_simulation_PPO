Although it's part of the U.S., a trip to Hawaii feels like visiting another country, thanks to the islands' otherworldly landscapes and the vibrant Hawaiian culture. Even from one island to the next, visitors are bound to discover differences. The same goes for hotels and resorts, too.  Some are contemporary and sleek, while others lean into the romantic notion of old Hawaii, with native materials and traditional styling. There are options at a wide range of price points and points values, too. From escapes with easy access to the best Hawaii beaches to retreats that offer postcard-perfect experiences all year long (there really is no best time to visit Hawaii, after all), the possibilities are practically endless in the United States' most tropical destination.  On the best islands in Hawaii, here are the 18 very best resorts and hotels and what not to miss at each.  ADVERTISEMENT  Oahu  Turtle Bay  Kahuku, Oahu, Hawaii, USA  TURTLE BAY RESORT/FACEBOOK  Best for: Freewheeling access to nearly 1,300 pristine acres of paradise on Oahu's North Shore.  Why stay here: The landmark luxury hotel on Oahu's coast reopened in 2021 after a total transformation that enhanced its lush, laid-back vibes while elevating its food and beverage experiences.  Best way to book: Book directly for the best rates and packages, or through your favorite credit card travel portal.  Book now  Get updates on special offers and compare our editors' top credit card picks with our daily newsletter.  There's no doubt $250 million dollars can do a lot for a hotel. But in the case of Turtle Bay Resort, the iconic and sole luxury resort on Oahu's North Shore, that substantial investment makes it feel almost like a new property was unveiled in 2022.  The 50th birthday, down-to-the-studs face-lift is evident in multitudinous ways across the sprawling nature reserve-like resort, which has an abundance of pristine waterfront (including world-class surf breaks) and also hiking and horseback riding trails.  From arrival, the great island outdoors are front and center, and the 408 refreshed guest rooms and suites embrace it wholly. For a splurge, opt for one of the 42 stand-alone beachfront bungalows, which come with access to a new shared swimming pool.  ADVERTISEMENT  No Hawaiian holiday is complete without a traditional lomi lomi massage, and the spa, with soaring glass walls, is a definite highlight here. It clocks in at 11,000 square feet, including a state-of-the-art fitness center, and offers mud masks, wraps and more \\u2014 all featuring sustainable ingredients so there's no guilt associated with your pampering.  The new Turtle Bay is also a dining destination in its own right. There is a fresh focus on just-harvested-from-the-farm ingredients such as hydroponic greens that come straight from the resort's Kuilima Farm, as well as seafood sourced from local waters. Eight dining outlets include the signature restaurant, Alaia, housemade mixology-focused lobby bar, Off The Lip, and an al fresco dinner series called Paniolo Luau that serves as an ode to Hawaiian cowboys, with roasted meats for mains, hula lessons and storytelling, among other cultural activities.

Why stay here: For more than a century this oceanfront hotel has offered itself to chic travelers as a sanctuary of world-class cuisine, next-level wellness and gracious hospitality.  Best way to book: Book through our partner Skylark to enjoy elitelike benefits and on-property credits.  Book now  Much has changed at Halekulani in its century-plus existence, but a lot hasn't, which is part of its timeless magic. The quiet location, for one, is as fabulous as it's always been, with perfect turquoise ocean panoramas from most of the rooms.  That palette dominates the otherwise serene white-on-white interiors, especially in the 453 guest rooms and suites, which have separate showers and tubs in the bathrooms, large balconies and welcome amenities, as well as turndown service with house-made chocolates.  It's the hotel's mission to leave its guests wanting for nothing, and in that spirit, the culinary offerings are especially robust and memorable. There's La Mer, with tinges of French flair, which feels especially romantic, and the coastal Italian restaurant Orchids, where three meals a day \\u2014 plus throwback afternoon tea \\u2014 are served alongside Waikiki Beach views. House Without A Key has nightly local music and a brick oven, plus a new pool bar, Earl's, where one truly feels on vacation after a coconut-cake martini.

Why stay here: This 1964 high-rise still has its sheen, thanks to its guest roster of royals and A-listers, a chef of Michelin acclaim, Diamond Head views and a lagoon brimming with bottlenose dolphins.  Best way to book: Book through our partner Skylark to enjoy elitelike benefits and on-property credits.  Book now  Known as the \\\"Ka-Hollywood\\\" for its robust roster of A-list guests, this resort just outside of the bustle of Waikiki has perfected the art of discretion. But even if you're not someone the paparazzi is chasing, the always attentive service and regal amenities are sure to make you feel special.  This is arguably the only place in Honolulu where you may see bottlenose dolphins jumping outside from the comfort of your king bed \\u2014 and that's from many of the rooms, not even a signature suite. With 338 total residential-style accommodations done up in soothing pastel hues, there's an only-in-Hawaii view for all.  Acclaimed executive chef Jonathan Mizukami oversees the hotel's five distinctive dining destinations, which include the fine dining restaurant Hoku's, where dishes are almost too pretty to eat. If those grand tasting menus are too profuse, the other options are plentiful. There's lounge-y and elevated The Veranda, the casual Seaside Grill, the beachfront Plumeria Beach House and Italian mecca Arancino.  Families celebrating special occasions can take home forever memories by booking photo shoots across the property's many picturesque spots, such as the sugary 800-foot beach where guests can count on complimentary lounge chairs and can also rent kayaks, snorkeling gear, boogie boards and stand-up paddleboards.  ADVERTISEMENT  If you're active, there are bike rentals, a Kahala jogging map, stand-up paddleboard yoga sessions and daily yoga and fitness classes. Of course, for those seeking the opposite, the Kahala Spa seeks to coddle via massages with warm pohaku stones or maybe a lomi stick foot massage followed by a tropical pedicure.

The Laylow  Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii, USA  THE LAYLOW/MARRIOTT.COM  Best for: Midcentury modern aficionados seeking a lively scene both day and night.

Best way to book: Book directly with Marriott to earn or redeem Marriott Bonvoy points and enjoy any elite benefits.  Book now  When the ocean isn't right out the window, design tends to take center stage, as is the case at this downtown Waikiki boutique hotel that harks to the classic 1960s visually. Even with the beach blocks away, there's a strong sense of Hawaii in the spirited wallpapers, artwork and furniture decorating its 251 midcentury-esque rooms and suites.  And perks of the Laylow's location go beyond easy foot access to plentiful restaurants and shops. Complimentary cultural lessons are on offer for an hour every morning. Ukulele, anyone? There are fire pits on a verdant rooftop garden bursting with native flora, an aesthetic that extends to Hideout, a greenhouse-themed restaurant that serves modern Hapa Hawaiian cuisine and even has a bar with live entertainment every single night. This chic urban jungle of a hotel is also home to three independently operated restaurants dishing out global fare that might transport you anywhere from South Korea to Texas.  Proudly pet-friendly, it's a place for travelers of all stripes \\u2014 especially those who love a saltwater swimming pool, another milieu with lush landscaping as well as half-submerged loungers for achieving the perfect tan while staying cool. It's almost like you don't need to bother with the beach.  Rates at The Laylow, Autograph Collection currently start at $332 or 57,000 points per night.

Best way to book: Book directly for the best rates and packages, or through your favorite credit card travel portal.  Book now  As much as Hawaii is for honeymooners, it's also for families. Let's be honest, no one enjoys all that sand and water as much as children. And nowhere is more of a magnet for them than Aulani, which is a collaboration between Walt Disney Imagineers, Hawaiian artisans and cultural experts.  The resort name means \\\"messenger of a chief,\\\" and it indeed brings Hawaiian culture to life in captivating ways for all ages on Oahu's leeward coast in the Ko Olina development. The property comprises not only 325 hotel rooms and 16 suites, but 481 Disney Vacation Club units and grand villas as well.  The 5,200-square-foot kids club is named appropriately for its location: Aunty's Beach House, and for children ages 4 to 12 there are complimentary supervised activities, including Hawaiian arts and crafts. Further experiences on-site include hula lessons and lei making, while evenings bring fireside storytelling and outdoor movie nights under the very stars ancient wayfinders used to reach...\"\n",

And that game is spot-on service and top-of-the-line luxury.  There are 466 rooms, suites and residences spread across 54 acres. Each has a private balcony, often with some breathtakingly vibrant vista just beyond, plus huge bathrooms with generous bathtubs and Diptyque toiletries.  Appropriately for such a sprawling property, there are six dining outlets. The Banyan Tree celebrates unique and sustainable Maui-sourced ingredients, Alaloa Lounge does light bites with cocktails as special as its sunsets, Olu Cafe is the place for tasty lunches of pupus and salads, and Burger Shack is self-explanatory (with milkshakes to boot). There's also Ulana for rich breakfasts and Kai Cafe for on-the-go bites and picnics.  The spa is worthy of spending an entire day, complete with saunas, whirlpools and steam rooms. But there's also so much to do under the Maui sun, like exploring a truly massive three-tiered swimming pool with cabanas, going kayaking and hitting some balls around at the tennis courts. There's a Ritz Kids program, and this is one of just five Ritz-Carlton hotels with a Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ambassadors of the Environment program outpost, which offers fun and enlightening family-friendly experiences that turn the resort into Mother Nature's classroom.  Rates at The Ritz-Carlton Maui, Kapalua currently start at $812 or 80,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night.

The spa is Hawaii's largest, with 40 treatment rooms, and the kids club is a gigantic 20,000 square feet, with plenty of activities to engage kids with diverse interests.  You need only look at the creative labyrinth of swimming pools, dubbed the Wailea Canyon Activity Pool, to understand why this resort is hugely popular with families. It spans six different levels connected by slides, a river with both rapids and gentle currents, waterfalls, caves and the world's first and only water elevator. Adventures are guaranteed. For adults, however, the giant Hibiscus Pool, inlaid with more than 2 million individual tiles, is a place for tranquility.  Grand Wailea has a scuba provider offering complimentary pool lessons to beginners, and Aqualani rents paddleboards. Outrigger tours are available to book, with specialized sessions for turtle watching, snorkeling and whale watching. The daily resort fee of $50 covers a generous number of extras, including one 45-minute photography session per stay, plus morning yoga classes, beach cruisers, ukulele lessons and beach umbrellas.  For fuel, guests can enjoy sushi in the Botero Lounge, pina coladas from Wailea Surf Haus and wood-fired pizzas from Aloha Trick Pony, among the half-dozen options.
